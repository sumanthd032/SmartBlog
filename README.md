## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, get the project files. If you don't have a repository, simply place all the project files into a folder named `smartblog`.

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# Navigate into your project directory
cd smartblog

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Or activate it (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Your Gemini API Key
This project uses the Google Gemini API for its AI features.

1.  Get your free API key from **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)**.
2.  Set this key as an environment variable. This is the most secure way to handle API keys.

    - **On macOS / Linux:**
      ```bash
      export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      ```
    - **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
      ```bash
      set GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      ```

### 5. Run the Application
With your virtual environment active and the API key set, start the server using Uvicorn.

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Your SmartBlog application is now running! Open your browser and navigate to **`http://127.0.0.1:8000`**.
